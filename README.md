#  Fire Hopper

Alert, Alert!
A fire broke out in the hotel, and you are the only firefighter capable of jumping from balcony to balcony.
Extinguish all the fire outbreaks and save everyone!



## My project idea
![Screenshot]: (https://excalidraw.com/#json=UPPDbEzzUAwD-Ahf2uOXM,oW28XWpvn-rarhSD1SxqzA)


The idea is to create a game. In the game the user will be a player that hops from balcony to balcony, saving people and extinguishing fire.

The player will have 5 stars, they are lives. Each time some inocent is burnt alive our player it looses one star and when it looses all of them its Game Over and the game is stoped.






## Backlog
The initial idea is this one but thinking about adding:

I would like to change the windows from time to time, like turn on/off the lights.

Id like to add rewards, maybe if the player saves someone they will give the user a 1Up, but not always, maybe a special save that you have to be quick.

Id like to add more difficulty when x time passes. Change the backround to night, and then maybe with thunder.




## Final Description "Firefighter Hero: Thunderstrike Rescue".
As a final product the game is called "Firefighter Hero: Thunderstrike Rescue".
First we have the intro screen, where the lights of the building turn on and off in a rhitmic way.
When you are ready, press START and let the disaster beggin.
Your mission is clear: extinguish the flames, save the trapped people, and ensure their safety. However, lose more than four inocent people's lives, and it's game over. 
The fire will start to spread slowly at first, but then it will get harder and harder.
Extinguishing fire is score++ .
Letting an inocent die is lives-- .
saving a Vip is lives++ .
